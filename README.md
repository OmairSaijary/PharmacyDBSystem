## Pharmacy inventory database system
The Pharmacy Inventory System is designed to manage the operations of a pharmacy. This includes tracking pharmacies, staff members, medications, inventory, suppliers, patients, prescriptions, and insurance information. The system ensures that each pharmacy is adequately staffed, maintains an accurate inventory of medications, and provides a seamless process for managing patient prescriptions and insurance details. It enforces various constraints to maintain data integrity and relationships among different entities.
